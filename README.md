# SoftSpot_front
Software. Insight. Delivered.


## Getting Started
A decoupled full-stack CRUD App that stores reviews about technologies and software.

To be used with [SoftSpot_back][https://github.com/wroth08/SoftSpot_back]

## Problem 
Where can a user find reliable software / tech reviews without targeted reviews based on paid advertising?

## Hypothesis
If we provide a review-based website for users to read up on software and approval from the community we can prevent being swayed to use one technology / software over another based on paid advertising.

## Reflection / Improvments
Due to the time crunch around this project, Team TecKNOWLEDGEY^n was not able to build out all of the features for the site but next iteration we would like to include the following implementations:

* Edit review page
* Search capabilities
* Software page verification
* Add professional/culture skills to user profile page
* Edit review
* Edit user profile
